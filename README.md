P+L Hotel,
This project was created by Luke Donnelly and Peter Lacey,
Our project features a website for a hotel,
The front end was handled by luke while the back end by peter,
Our website hosts many features like an admin page aswell as tables which display room prices and floors,
There is a customer manager and a room manager login where admin can login and add, edit or delete content,
There is a contact page where users can send the hotel an email regarding their stay,
There is also a review section and a section which gives informstion about the hotel,
